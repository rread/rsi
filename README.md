# rsi - Robert's Scheme Interpreter

This aspirationally titled project is an experimental lisp-like
interpreter inspired by Peter Norvig's lis.py but written in
Go. Originally this was moving torwards a more Common Lisp-ish
implementation, but now it's getting to be closer to scheme as the
suggest. It's a learing process, and there is still has a long way to go.

Unlike lis.py, which used native python lists, this implementation is
based on cons lists and is aiming to be a more complete
implementation. Someday.

## Currently supports (more or less)

* integers and arithmetic
* quote
* strings (no string functions yet though)
* define
* set!
* begin
* lambda
* if 
* cons, car, cdr
